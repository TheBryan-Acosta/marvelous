# Marvelous

MARVELOUS is a web application for the use of Marvel movie and comic book fans, and just about anyone who wants to learn more about Marvel characters. The app features a search function that let's you explore various versions of a character. For example, type "spider-man" and receive 13 results to view from the [Marvel Comics API](https://developer.marvel.com/)! We also built a forum specifically for users to be able to comment and share their interest in the Marvel Universe.

## User Story
AS A USER I want to be able to use an app to search for my favorite Marvel superheroes and villains. 

I WANT TO be able to read about the specific characters and their abilities. 

I ALSO WANT TO create a profile so that I can leave comments underneath the characters information, along with the ability read other users comments as well.
