## User Story
AS A USER I want to be able to use an app to search for my favorite Marvel superheroes and villains. 

I WANT TO be able to read about the specific characters and their abilities. 

I ALSO WANT TO create a profile so that I can leave comments underneath the characters information, along with the ability read other users comments as well. 

WHEN I AM DONE I would like to be able to log out of my account.
